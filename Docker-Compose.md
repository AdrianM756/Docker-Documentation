## Docker Compose
<br>

[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) Is a tool used for defining and managing multi-container Docker applications, automating the process of building, running, and linking multiple services like web servers, databases, and caching services. With Docker Compose, you use a YAML configuration file, known as the [Compose file](https://docs.docker.com/compose/intro/compose-application-model/#the-compose-file), to configure your applicationâ€™s services, and then you create and start all the services from your configuration with the Compose CLI.

Determine if the Docker compose is installed on the system. We can verify it using the command:

```
docker-compose --version
```
